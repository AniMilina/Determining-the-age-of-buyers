# Determining-the-age-of-buyers  

The Bread-Sol supermarket chain is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:  

Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;  
Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.  

Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people indicating their age.  
Instructions for completing the project  
Conduct an exploratory analysis of a set of photographs.  
Prepare the data for training.  
Train a neural network and calculate its quality.
